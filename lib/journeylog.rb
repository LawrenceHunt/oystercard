class JourneyLog

  # Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
  # test drive the development of JourneyLog class
  # Initialize the JourneyLog with a journey_class parameter (hint: journey_class expects an object that knows how to create Journeys. Can you think of an object that already does this?)
  # #start should start a new journey with an entry station
  # a private method #current_journey should return an incomplete journey or create a new journey
  # #finish should add an exit station to the current_journey
  # #journeys should return a list of all previous journeys without exposing the internal array to external modification
  # remove redundant code from OysterCard class
